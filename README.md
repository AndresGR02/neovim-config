# Neovim Configuration

**Introduction**
Welcome to my Neovim configuration! This config aims to provide you with all of the necessary tools to start working with neovim right away as smoothly as possible
Please note that this configuration is still under development.

**Getting Started**

To use this configuration in your own Neovim setup, follow these simple steps:

1. **Getting ready to clone**: Cd into the ~/.config/ directory   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git in the previously specified directory.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/AndresGR02/neovim-config.git
3. **That's probably it! (hopefully)**
